i want to develop a quick bingo maker in web using html and js. 

here are the details:

1. it has a bingo board of 5x5.
2. There is a list of options that the user can select from.
3. There should be filter for the options because it's pretty long list.
4. Every time the user picks one, it automatically gets populated in the bingo board.
5. You can of course click on the option in the bingo board and it gets removed.

That's it for the start.

Please show me the code for it, in a HTML and a JS file.
